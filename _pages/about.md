Hello! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UIC. My research focuses on Conformal prediction, Causal inference, and large language models (LLMs).

I obtained my B.S. degree from Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics and my M.S. degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I was supervised by Prof. Kyumin Lee.
